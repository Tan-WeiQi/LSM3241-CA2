# LSM3241 Genomic Data Analysis Project 2 in Linux
Individual Project: Hunting for Genomic Insertions and their Consequences
## Objective
The aim of this study is to identify possible alterations caused by one or more insertions of transposon
(Ty5-6p genebank accession U19263.1) in the yeast genome. Mapping and analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS)
data are used to identify the mapped positions and consequences of transposon insertions.
## Programs
1. Ubuntu Linux system, Bash scripting
2. Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)
3. Bioinformatics packages: fastqc, bowtie2, samtools
4. Excel
## How to use?
1. Download sacCer.fa (yeast genome) and ty5_6p.fa (tranposon)
2. Follow steps given in Full Reproducible Codes.pdf
3. The 2 CSV files are results from running all the codes and bash scripts in step 2, which will be
put into IGV for visual analysis
4. Literature review and result analysis presented in the final report
